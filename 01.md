## Machine Learning Interview Questions
### 1. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
There are three types of machine learning:  
1. Supervised Learning  
In supervised machine learning, a model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.  
2. Unsupervised Learning  
In unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled data. A model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.  
3. Reinforcement Learning  
Using reinforcement learning, the model can learn based on the rewards it received for its previous action.   
Consider an environment where an agent is working. The agent is given a target to achieve. Every time the agent takes some action toward the target, it is given positive feedback. And, if the action taken is going away from the goal, the agent is given negative feedback. 
### 2. What Is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts. These impact the model’s ability to generalize and don’t apply to new data.   
When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is known as overfitting.  

There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:  
1. Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function  
2. Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be reduced  
3. Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used  
4. If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters  
### 3. What Is ‘training Set’ and ‘test Set’ in a Machine Learning Model? How Much Data Will You Allocate for Your Training, Validation, and Test Sets?
There is a three-step process followed to create a model:  
1. Train the model  
2. Test the model   
3. Deploy the model  

Consider a case where you have labeled data for 1,000 records. One way to train the model is to expose all 1,000 records during the training process. Then you take a small set of the same data to test the model, which would give good results in this case.

But, this is not an accurate way of testing. So, we set aside a portion of that data called the ‘test set’ before starting the training process. The remaining data is called the ‘training set’ that we use for training the model. The training set passes through the model multiple times until the accuracy is high, and errors are minimized.

Now, we pass the test data to check if the model can accurately predict the values and determine if training is effective. If you get errors, you either need to change your model or retrain it with more data.

Regarding the question of how to split the data into a training set and test set, there is no fixed rule, and the ratio can vary based on individual preferences. 
### 4. How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?
One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value.

There are two useful methods in Pandas:
1. IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them
2. Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value
### 5. How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?
When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seem to work better because they are less likely to overfit. 

For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large. Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships.
### 6. Explain the Confusion Matrix with Respect to Machine Learning Algorithms.
A confusion matrix (or error matrix) is a specific table that is used to measure the performance of an algorithm. It is mostly used in supervised learning; in unsupervised learning, it’s called the matching matrix.

The confusion matrix has two parameters:
1. Actual
2. Predicted

It also has identical sets of features in both of these dimensions.

Consider a confusion matrix (binary matrix) shown below:
![title](01.jpg)

For actual values:

Total Yes = 12+1 = 13

Total No = 3+9 = 12 

Similarly, for predicted values:

Total Yes = 12+3 = 15

Total No = 1+9 = 10 

For a model to be accurate, the values across the diagonals should be high. The total sum of all the values in the matrix equals the total observations in the test data set. 

For the above matrix, total observations = 12+3+1+9 = 25

Now, accuracy = sum of the values across the diagonal / total dataset

= (12+9) / 25

= 21 / 25

= 84%
### 7. What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?
False positives are those cases which wrongly get classified as True but are False. 

False negatives are those cases which wrongly get classified as False but are True.

In the term ‘False Positive,’ the word ‘Positive’ refers to the ‘Yes’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative. 
![title](02.jpg)

So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:

False-positive = 3

True positive = 12

Similarly, in the term ‘False Negative,’ the word ‘Negative’ refers to the ‘No’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. And the complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as negative, but the actual value is positive.

So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:

False Negative = 1

True Negative = 9
### 8. What Are the Three Stages of Building a Model in Machine Learning?
The three stages of building a machine learning model are:
1. Model Building

Choose a suitable algorithm for the model and train it according to the requirement

2. Model Testing

Check the accuracy of the model through the test data

3. Applying the Model

Make the required changes after testing and use the final model for real-time projects

Here, it’s important to remember that once in a while, the model needs to be checked to make sure it’s working correctly. It should be modified to make sure that it is up-to-date.
### 9. What Is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves systems that think and learn like humans using artificial neural networks. The term ‘deep’ comes from the fact that you can have several layers of neural networks. 

One of the primary differences between machine learning and deep learning is that feature engineering is done manually in machine learning. In the case of deep learning, the model consisting of neural networks will automatically determine which features to use (and which not to use). 
### 10. What Are the Differences Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
1. Machine Learning

Enables machines to take decisions on their own, based on past data
    
It needs only a small amount of data for training
    
Works well on the low-end system, so you don't need large machines 
    
Most features need to be identified in advance and manually coded
    
The problem is divided into two parts and solved individually and then combined

2. Deep Learning

Enables machines to take decisions with the help of artificial neural networks
    
It needs a large amount of training data 

Needs high-end machines because it requires a lot of computing power 

The machine learns the features from the data it is provided

The problem is solved in an end-to-end manner

### 11. What Are the Applications of Supervised Machine Learning in Modern Businesses?

Applications of supervised machine learning include:

1. Email Spam Detection

Here we train the model using historical data that consists of emails categorized as spam or not spam. This labeled information is fed as input to the model.

2. Healthcare Diagnosis

By providing images regarding a disease, a model can be trained to detect if a person is suffering from the disease or not.

3. Sentiment Analysis

This refers to the process of using algorithms to mine documents and determine whether they’re positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment.

4. Fraud Detection

Training the model to identify suspicious patterns, we can detect instances of possible fraud.

### 12. What Is Semi-supervised Machine Learning?

Supervised learning uses data that is completely labeled, whereas unsupervised learning uses no training data.

In the case of semi-supervised learning, the training data contains a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

### 13. What Are Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques? 

There are two techniques used in unsupervised learning: clustering and association.

Clustering

Clustering problems involve data to be divided into subsets. These subsets, also called clusters, contain data that are similar to each other. Different clusters reveal different details about the objects, unlike classification or regression.

### 14. What Is the Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning?

Supervised learning - This model learns from the labeled data and makes a future prediction as output.

Unsupervised learning - This model uses unlabeled input data and allows the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

### 15. What Is the Difference Between Inductive Machine Learning and Deductive Machine Learning?

1. Inductive Learning

It observes instances based on defined principles to draw a conclusion

Example: Explaining to a child to keep away from the fire by showing a video where fire causes damage.

2. Deductive Learning

It concludes experiences

Example: Allow the child to play with fire. If he or she gets burned, they will learn that it is dangerous and will refrain from making the same mistake again

### 16. Compare K-means and KNN Algorithms.
1. K-means

K-Means is unsupervised. K-Means is a clustering algorithm. The points in each cluster are similar to each other, and each cluster is different from its neighboring clusters.

2. KNN

KNN is supervised in nature. KNN is a classification algorithm. It classifies an unlabeled observation based on its K (can be any number) surrounding neighbors.

### 17. What Is ‘naive’ in the Naive Bayes Classifier?

The classifier is called ‘naive’ because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct. 

The algorithm assumes that the presence of one feature of a class is not related to the presence of any other feature (absolute independence of features), given the class variable.

For instance, a fruit may be considered to be a cherry if it is red in color and round in shape, regardless of other features. This assumption may or may not be right (as an apple also matches the description).

### 18. Explain How a System Can Play a Game of Chess Using Reinforcement Learning.

Reinforcement learning has an environment and an agent. The agent performs some actions to achieve a specific goal. Every time the agent performs a task that is taking it towards the goal, it is rewarded. And, every time it takes a step which goes against that goal or in reverse direction, it is penalized. 

Earlier, chess programs had to determine the best moves after much research on numerous factors. Building a machine designed to play such games would require many rules to be specified. 

With reinforced learning, we don’t have to deal with this problem as the learning agent learns by playing the game. It will make a move (decision), check if it’s the right move (feedback), and keep the outcomes in memory for the next step it takes (learning). There is a reward for every correct decision the system takes and punishment for the wrong one. 

### 19. How Will You Know Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Choose for Your Classification Problem?

While there is no fixed rule to choose an algorithm for a classification problem, you can follow these guidelines:

If accuracy is a concern, test different algorithms and cross-validate them.
    
If the training dataset is small, use models that have low variance and high bias.
    
If the training dataset is large, use models that have high variance and little bias.

### 20. How Is Amazon Able to Recommend Other Things to Buy? How Does the Recommendation Engine Work?

Once a user buys something from Amazon, Amazon stores that purchase data for future reference and finds products that are most likely also to be bought, it is possible because of the Association algorithm, which can identify patterns in a given dataset.
